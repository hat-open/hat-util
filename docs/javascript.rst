`@hat-core/util` - JavaScript utility library
=============================================

Utility library for manipulation of JSON data.

Main characteristics:

  * input/output data types are limited to JSON data, functions and
    `undefined` (sparse arrays and complex objects with prototype chain are
    not supported)

  * functional API with curried functions (similar to ramdajs)

  * implementation based on natively supported browser JS API

  * scope limited to most used functions in hat projects

  * usage of `paths` instead of `lenses`
